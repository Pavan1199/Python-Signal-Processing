Respected sir,

	com_step_ramp1
	com_step_ramp2

These functions are same as one file cannot be accessed by all the programmes i created four such files.
The file names are same as question numbers.
For questions in 16, each sub-question has a seperate file and the answers printed are in order from 1-10 question numbers.

cau_noncau
inv_noninv
linear_nonlinear
sta_unsta_func
